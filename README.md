## Executive Summary

The aim of this analysis is to focus on Nashville housing boom from 2013 to 2016. More 
specifically, the analysis should help answer the following questions: 

* Where are most demanded properties located?

* What is the average sale price of a property in Nashville?

* How did Nashville housing market evolve from 2013 to 2016? 

* What type of homes are mostly demanded?

* How much did property agencies generate in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016


## Methodology

Before performing the analysis, the data was collected through a public domain 
sure itâ€™s cleaned, reliable and error-free by finding and filling missing values, removing 
(http://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data), then wrangled to make
duplicates and normalizing data. After that, I explored and gained insights through variables, 
and finally proceeded to data visualization.
